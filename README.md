# ML-Test-Client

## Introduction

### Why do we need this?

When working with Machine Learning models, soon you realize that even though they could work to make financial predictions, you need to set a whole array of parameters that not only define the architecture of the model, but also the shape of the data and may other things. For each of these parameters, there is a valid range of values that could work, but only in combination with other parameters which also have their own valid ranges.

Nobody knows what combination is going to produce the best results. For this kind of problems, the results are measured by the error measured of the predictions that a trained model can proviede, compared with the actual values. In order to obtain the error measure, first a ML model with certain parameters and certain data need to be created and trained, which usually takes time. 

Testing combinations of parameters and data (with potentially hundreds of indicators to choose from, thousands of crypto assets, and dozens of time-frames) by hand, would be a nightmare. This system solves that problems by automating the discovery of the best performing ML models, for a certain range of parameters values and certain set of indicators. 

It allows us to define for each parameter a range of valid values, creating a set of Test Cases based on all the possible combinations of all the values inside the valid  ranges for all parameters. Then we only need distributed processing power to test all the combinations in a reasonable time and find which parameters / data configurations produces the best results. Best results means the best predictions in crypto markets.

Over time, we will learn how to trim those ranges so that finally we need to search for the best performing models at a narrower space. At a production environment we will be forever testing since datasets are changing over time. 

It is important to understand that this APP does not prepare the dataset to be tested. This is done by the Test Server App. That means that this app does not need to be ran together with Superalgos or any other data provider. It only depends on the Test Server which handles the management of the Test Cases and the generation of the datasets to be used at each one of the tests.

### How does this App work?

This app is used to autonomously test different set of parameters to see which Machine Learnning models can make better predictions.

This is the Client part of a system that also has a Server part. The Test Server app manages a set of different Test Cases that needs to be tried out.

Each Test Client app, connects to the Test Server app via webRTC. Once connected, it will enter into an infinite loop requesting new Test Cases to the Test Server.

Once a Test Case is received, the Test Client app will write 2 files at the notebooks folder (which is a shared volume with the Tensor Flow container):

* parameters.CSV
* time-series.CSV

After these files are written, the Test Client App will use the npm package called docker-compose, to execute inside the Tensor Flow container the Bitcoin_Factory_LSTM.py script. 

This script reads boths files, and creates a ML model using the provided parameters and the data at the time-series file. It's execution could take several minutes. Once finished, a set of results are sent back from the Python script to the Test Client app, which in turn sends via webRTC the results to the Test Server app. This app creates a report at Google Sheets with all the consolidated test results provided by all the Test Clients that contributed running the individual tests.

The Test Client app then wait for 10 seconds and repeat the process again, requesting a new Test Case to test.

### Scalability

Since the Test Client and Test Server interact in a p2p way via webRTC, that means that we can run a Test Server at home and get help to process Test Cases from anywhere in the world without the need to pay for cloud servers, and without limits regarding the amount of people that can help.


## Pre-Requisites

* nodejs
* npm
* git
* docker
* docker-compose

## Your-Test-Client-Id

To run this software you need to get an Id for your Test Client. 

## Setup

### Repositories Cloning 

Clone the needed repositories.

```sh
mkdir Bitcoin-Factory
cd Bitcoin-Factory
git clone http://github.com/Bitcoin-Factory/ML-Test-Client
cd ML-Test-Client
git clone http://github.com/Bitcoin-Factory/ML-Test-WebRTC
cd ..
npm install node-pre-gyp
npm update
```

Second, build the Docker Image.

### On x86 Processors

```sh
cd DockerBuild
docker build -t bitcoin-factory-machine-learning .
cd ..
```

### On xArm Processors

```sh
cd ArmDockerBuild
docker build -t bitcoin-factory-machine-learning .
cd ..
```

## Usage

First, run the Docker Container.

### on Windows
```sh
docker run -it --rm --name Bitcoin-Factory-ML -v /notebooks:/tf/notebooks -p 8888:8888 bitcoin-factory-machine-learning
```

Second, run the App.

```sh
node runTestClient
```

### on Ubuntu Server

```sh
sudo docker run -it --rm --name Bitcoin-Factory-ML -v ~/Bitcoin-Factory/ML-Test-Client/notebooks:/tf/notebooks -p 8888:8888 bitcoin-fac
tory-machine-learning
```

```sh
sudo node runTestClient Your-Test-Client-Id
```

## on Mac OS

### File Sharing

Before running that command for the first time, you will need to share the notebooks folder.

At the Settings of the Docker App, use File sharing to allow local directories on the Mac to be shared with Linux containers. By default the /Users, /Volume, /private, /tmp and /var/folders directory are shared. As this project is outside this directory then it must be added to the list. Otherwise you may get Mounts denied or cannot start service errors at runtime.

### File Share Settings:

To add the 'notebooks' Directory: Click + and navigate to the 'notebooks' directory.

Apply & Restart makes the directory available to containers using Dockerâ€™s bind mount (-v) feature.

### Run the Container 

The command to run the container on Mac should be like this (mind Your-User-Name):

```sh
docker run -it --rm --name Bitcoin-Factory-ML -v /Users/Your-User-Name/Bitcoin-Factory/ML-Test-Client/notebooks:/tf/notebooks -p 8888:8888 bitcoin-factory-machine-learning
```

```sh
node runTestClient Your-Test-Client-Id
```

## Docker Cheat Sheet

If you get the error:

```sh
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/Bitcoin-Factory-ML" is already in use by container ...
```

Use the command

```sh
docker container prune
```

to fix it.
